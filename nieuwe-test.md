The first test didn't work well. I probably made a mistake by indicating that it should upload a Jekyll file to Github. What happened was that it changed the three dashes in the YAML part of the file into a horizontal line.

So instead of leaving the parsing to Jekyll/Github, StackEdit did it already. 

That didn't look good. So here's another try.
